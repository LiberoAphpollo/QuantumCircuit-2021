Introduction
============

Welcome to QISKit! Interested in quantum computing and programming a
real live quantum processor? QISKit is a simple set of tools for anyone
to get started exploring quantum information science. We have put
together a set of Jupyter notebooks to demonstrate how to use our tools
and explore the quantum world.

The notebooks are organized into the following topics:

:ref:`introducing-the-tools`

:ref:`exploring-quantum-information-concepts`
		 
:ref:`verification_tools_for_quantum_science`

:ref:`appications_of_short_depth_quantum_circuits_on_quantum_computers`
			
:ref:`quantum-games`

.. _introducing-the-tools:

Introducing the tools
=====================

In this first topic, we break down the tools in this QISKit SDK, and
introduce all the different parts to make this useful. Our list of
introductory notebooks:
- :doc:`Getting Started with QISKit SDK <tutorial4developer>` shows how to use the the QISKit SDK tools.
- Compiling and Running a Quantum Progam [coming soon]
- Loading and Saving a Quantum Program [coming soon]
- Visualizing a Quantum State [coming soon]

.. _exploring-quantum-information-concepts:

Exploring quantum information concepts
======================================

The next set of notebooks shows how you can explore some simple concepts
of quantum information science.

-  :doc:`Superposition and Entanglement <superposition_and_entanglement>`
   illustrates how to make simple quantum states on one and two qubits,
   and demonstrates concepts such as quantum superpositions and
   entanglement.
-  Single-qubit states: amplitude and phase [coming soon] illustrates
   more complicated single qubit states.
-  :doc:`Entanglement revisited <entanglement_revisited>` -
   illustrates the CHSH inequality, and extensions for three qubits
   (Mermin).
-  Quantum teleportation [coming soon]
-  Quantum superdense coding [coming soon]


.. _verification_tools_for_quantum_science:

Verification tools for quantum information science
==================================================

The third set of notebooks allows you to explore tools for verification
of quantum systems with commonly-used techniques such as tomography and
randomized benchmarking.

- Quantum coherence studies [coming soon]
- Quantum state tomography [coming soon]
- Quantum process tomography [coming soon]
- Pauli randomized benchmarking [coming soon]
- Standard randomized benchmarking [coming soon]
- Purity randomized benchmarking [coming soon]
- Leakage randomized benchmarking [coming soon]
- Simultaneous randomized benchmarking [coming soon]
- Gate set tomography [coming soon]

.. _appications_of_short_depth_quantum_circuits_on_quantum_computers:

Applications of quantum information science
===========================================

To fully grasp the possibilities, this set of notebooks shows how you
can explore applications of short depth quantum computers.

Sampling
--------

-  :doc:`Quantum optimization <classical_optimization>` -
   illustrates how to use a quantum computer to look at optimization
   problems.
-  :doc:`Quantum chemistry by variational quantum eigensolver method <quantum_chemistry>` [coming
   soon] - illustrates how to use a quantum computer to look at
   chemistry problems.

Non Sampling
------------

-  Iterative phase estimation [coming soon]

.. _quantum-games:

Quantum Games
=============

[coming soon]
