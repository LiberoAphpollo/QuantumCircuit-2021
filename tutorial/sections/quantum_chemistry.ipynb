    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the earliest and most compelling applications of quantum computation is the idea of using quantum computers to simulate other quantum systems. Quantum simulation encompasses a range of tasks, including most significantly \n",
    "    \n",
    "1. simulation of the time evolution of quantum systems\n",
    "2. computation of thermal or ground state properties. \n",
    "\n",
    "These tasks are useful for applications such as quantum chemistry and in the simulation of properties of strongly correlated materials. Here we will focus on the second one.  These states encode a lot of the information about the physical system of interest, and are highly relevant for understanding the properties of materials and complex molecules. The ground state is the starting point for mapping out the phase diagram of condensed matter Hamiltonians and encodes the central information of electronic structure problems in quantum Chemistry. The problem asks the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "For some physical Hamiltonian *H*, (approximately) prepare the eigenstate $|\\psi_G\\rangle$, i.e. $H|\\psi_G\\rangle=E_G|\\psi_G\\rangle$, where $E_G$ is the smallest eigenvalue of $H$.\n",
    "    \n",
    "It is known that in general this problem is intractable even on a quantum computer. This means that we cannot expect an efficient quantum algorithm which prepares the ground state of general local Hamiltonians. Despite this limitation, for a specific Hamiltonian of interest it might be possible to exploit special structure to solve the above problem efficiently. Currently, (at least) four different methods exist to approach this problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Quantum phase estimation: Here we assume that we can approximately prepare the state $|\\psi_G\\rangle$ and then this routine is used to give the eigenvalue. \n",
    "2. Adiabatic theorem of quantum mechanics. Here we assume that the system can be moved from an easy prepared ground state adiabtically to the harder state. \n",
    "3. Variational quantum eigensolver. Here we assume that ground state can be represented by a prameterization containing a small (e.g., polynomial) number of parameters.\n",
    "4. Dissipative (non-unitary) quantum operation which has the ground state as a fixed point. Here we assume that we can design this dissiapation map. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here we are interested in the third method as this is most likely the simplest to be realized on near term devices. \n",
    "\n",
    "The general idea is to define a paremeterization $|\\psi(\\theta)\\rangle$ and minimize the energy \n",
    "\n",
    "$$E(\\theta) = \\langle \\psi(\\theta)| H |\\psi(\\theta)\\rangle,$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "Assumption 1. The set of controls $\\theta^*$ that minimizes this objective funtion has a size $|\\theta|$ that ploynomial in number of qubits.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For any Hamiltoian (and shown below) this can be rewritten as a sum over pauli operations  \n",
    "\n",
    "$$H = \\sum_i^M w_i P_i,$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "then E(\\theta) can be estimated by sampling \n",
    "\n",
    "$$E(\\theta) = \\sum_i^M w_i \\langle \\psi(\\theta)| P_i |\\psi(\\theta)\\rangle,$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "Assumption 2. The number of terms to be estimated is polynomial in the number of qubits. In the most general case $M=4^n$ but for physical interesting Hamiltonians like chemisty M = N^4 where N is the number of orbitals.\n",

    "### Approximate Universal Quantum Computing for quantum chemisty problems\n",
    "\n",
    "Recently there has been interest in investgating approximate algorithims for optimization [ADD REFS]. Here we show a slight variation to them which we have been looking at under the general concept of approximate quantum computing.  In general we dont expect this to have a expodential speed up but due to the nature and importance of these problems it is worth investigating Heuristic approaches on a quantum computer. The hope is that that due to the large space of a quantum computer we can explore the problem by exploiting entanglement to trade expodential calls for quantum depth. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Algorithm works as follows:\n",
    "1. Choose a Ising problem (can have higher powers of Z).\n",
    "2. Choose the maximum depth of the quantum circuit (this could be done adaptively.\n",
    "3. Choos a set of controls $\\theta$ and make a trial function $|\\psi(\\theta)\\rangle$.\n",
    "4. Evaluate $C = \\langle\\psi~|H|~\\psi\\rangle = \\sum_i w_i \\langle\\psi~|Z_i|~\\psi\\rangle+ \\sum_{i<j} w_{ij} \\langle\\psi~|Z_iZ_j|~\\psi\\rangle$ by sampling the outcome of the circuit and adding the expectation values together.\n",
    "5. Use a classical optimizer to choose a new set of controls.\n",
    "6. Continue until the C has reach a minimium and return $|\\langle z~|\\psi\\rangle|^2$.\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "Not some benifits on this over making this is real hardware is we are not limited to the connectivity of the device and it is trival to map optimize problems to the virtual Hamiltonain which we make though simulation. Getting higher orders such as $Z_iZ_jZ_k$ is simple which in real hardware is generally possible. The noise is mainly due to the gates and if the depth is small enough we can perform this high fidelity.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is our belief the difficult of finding good Heuristic algorithms will come down ot the trial funciton. Do we choose a trial function that has entanglement in a way that best aligns with the problem (as indicated in [REF]). or do we make the amount of entanglement a variable [REF]. These questions are beyond our goals here and we will consider only the simplie trial functions \n",
    "\n",
    "$$|\\psi(\\theta)\\rangle  = [U_\\mathrm{single}(\\theta) U_\\mathrm{entangler}]^m |+\\rangle$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $U_\\mathrm{entangler}$ is a function of cPhase gates (fully entangling), and $U_\\mathrm{single}(\\theta) = Z(\\theta_2)Y(\\theta_1)^{\\otimes n}$, where $n$ is the number of qubits and $m$ is the depth of the quantum circuit. The motivation for this choice is that for these classical problems this choice allows us to search over the space of states that have only real superpostions and dont have to worry about refocusing out all the complex phases but still can exploit the entanglment to search for solutions.\n"
