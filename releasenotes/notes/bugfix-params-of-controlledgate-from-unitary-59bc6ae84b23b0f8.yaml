    Fixed an issue where the :attr:`~qiskit.circuit.ControlledGate.parameter`
    attribute of a :class:`~qiskit.circuit.ControlledGate` object built from
    a :class:`~qiskit.extensions.UnitaryGate` was not being set to the
    unitary matrix of the :class:`~qiskit.extensions.UnitaryGate` object.
    Previously, :meth:`~qiskit.extensions.UnitaryGate.control` was building a
    :class:`~qiskit.circuit.ControlledGate` with the ``parameter`` attribute
    set to the controlled version of
    :class:`~qiskit.extensions.UnitaryGate` matrix.
    This would lead to a modification of the ``parameter`` of the base
    :class:`~qiskit.extensions.UnitaryGate` object and subsequent calls to
    :meth:`~qiskit.circuit.ControlledGate.inverse` was creating
    the inverse of a double-controlled :class:`~qiskit.extensions.UnitaryGate`.
    Fixed `#5750 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/issues/5750>`__
