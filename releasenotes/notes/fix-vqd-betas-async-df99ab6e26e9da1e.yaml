    Fixed the autoevaluation of the beta parameters in
    :class:`~qiskit.algorithms.eigensolvers.VQD`, added support for
    :class:`~qiskit.quantum_info.SparsePauliOp` inputs, and fixed
    the energy evaluation function to leverage the asynchronous execution
    of primitives, by only retrieving the job results after both
    jobs have been submitted.
