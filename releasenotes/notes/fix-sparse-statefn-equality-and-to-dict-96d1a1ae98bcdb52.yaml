fixes:
  - |
    Fixed an issue in the :meth:`qiskit.opflow.SparseVectorStateFn.to_dict_fn`
    method, which previously had at most one entry for the all zero state due
    to an index error.
  - |
    Fixed an issue in the :meth:`qiskit.opflow.SparseVectorStateFn.equals`
    method so that is properly returning ``True`` or ``False`` instead of a
    sparse vector comparison of the single elements.
