    Added :meth:`.Clifford.from_linear_function` and :meth:`.Clifford.from_permutation`
    methods that create a :class:`.Clifford` object from :class:`~.LinearFunction`
    and from :class:`~.PermutationGate` respectively. As a consequence, a :class:`.Clifford`
    can now be constructed directly from a :class:`~.LinearFunction`, a :class:`.PermutationGate`, or
    a quantum circuit containing such gates.
