    Enabled circuit-to-pulse scheduling using :class:`~.BackendV2`.

    .. code-block:: python

      # import a fake backend which is a sub-class of BackendV2
      from qiskit.providers.fake_provider import FakePerth
      from qiskit.compiler.scheduler import schedule
      from qiskit.circuit import QuantumCircuit

      qc = QuantumCircuit(1, 1)
      qc.x(0)
      qc.measure(0,0)
      sched = schedule(circuits=qc, backend=FakePerth())

    Since :class:`.BackendV2` was not supported by the :func:`~qiskit.compiler.schedule`
    function, this caused the :meth:`~.schedule` method to error out when the ``backend``
    argument was supplied with an instance of :class:`.BackendV2`.
    Refer to `#10837 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit/issues/10837>`_ for more information.
