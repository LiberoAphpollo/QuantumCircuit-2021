    Removed support for using the keyword ``rho`` for the first positional argument in
    :func:`~qiskit.visualization.plot_state_hinton`,
    :func:`~qiskit.visualization.plot_bloch_multivector`,
    :func:`~qiskit.visualization.plot_state_city`, :func:`~qiskit.visualization.plot_state_paulivec`,
    and :func:`~qiskit.visualization.plot_state_qsphere`. The use of ``rho`` has been replaced by
    ``state``, which can be used instead.
    Removed ``qiskit.scheduler.utils`` as all contained functions were moved to
    :mod:`qiskit.pulse.macros` and :mod:`qiskit.pulse.utils`.
    All these were deprecated since 0.15 (released on August 06, 2020) and now they are removed.
