    A new method :meth:`.Parameter.assign` has been added. This method primarily serves as
    a fast path to improve the performance of :meth:`.QuantumCircuit.assign_parameters`
    for the common case of circuits that predominantly contain
    "expressions" that are actually just single parameters to be assigned later.
