upgrade_visualization:
  - |
    The class constructor arguments ``qregs``, ``cregs``,
    ``layout`` and ``global_phase`` for :class:`.visualization.QCircuitImage`
    are removed, as they were deprecated in 0.20.
upgrade_transpiler:
  - |
    In :class:`.transpiler.CouplingMap` method ``subgraph`` is removed
    as deprecated in 0.20. :meth:`~reduce` can be used in place of method ``subgraph``.
upgrade_synthesis:
  - |
    The parameter ``order`` in :class:`.synthesis.SuzukiTrotter`
    constructor raises an exception instead of deprecation warning when
    set in an odd number. Suzuki product formulae are symmetric and
    therefore only defined for even orders.
