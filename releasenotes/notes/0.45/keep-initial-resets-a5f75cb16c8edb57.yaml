    Disabled the use of the :class:`.RemoveResetInZeroState` class in the preset passmanagers.
    Previously, when :func:`.transpile` or :func:`.generate_preset_pass_manager` was run with
    ``optimization_level`` at level 1, 2, or 3, it would run :class:`.RemoveResetInZeroState`.
    However, this pass prohibited the notion of arbitrary initial states unless explicitly set
    to zeros with resets. If you need to run the pass as part of your compilation pipeline, you
    can run something like::

        pm = generate_preset_pass_manager(1, backend)
        pm.init.append(RemoveResetInZeroState())
        pm.run(circuit)

    to retain this functionality for your circuit compilation.
