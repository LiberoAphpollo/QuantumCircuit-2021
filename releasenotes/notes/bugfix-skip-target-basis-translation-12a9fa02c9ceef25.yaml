    Fixed an issue with the :class:`~qiskit.transpiler.passes.BasisTranslator`
    transpiler pass which in some cases would translate gates already in the
    target basis. This would potentially result in both longer execution time
    and less optimal results.
    Fixed `#6085 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/issues/6085>`__
