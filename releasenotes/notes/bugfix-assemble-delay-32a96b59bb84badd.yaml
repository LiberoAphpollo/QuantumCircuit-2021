    Pulse :py:class:`~qiskit.pulse.instructions.Delay` instructions are now
    explicitly assembled as :class:`~qiskit.qobj.PulseQobjInstruction` objects
    included in the :class:`~qiskit.qobj.PulseQobj` output from
    :func:`~qiskit.compiler.assemble`.

    Previously, we could ignore :py:class:`~qiskit.pulse.instructions.Delay`
    instructions in a :class:`~qiskit.pulse.Schedule` as part of
    :func:`~qiskit.compiler.assemble` as the time was explicit in the
    :class:`~qiskit.qobj.PulseQobj` objects. But, now with pulse gates, there
    are situations where we can schedule ONLY a delay, and not including the
    delay itself would remove the delay.
