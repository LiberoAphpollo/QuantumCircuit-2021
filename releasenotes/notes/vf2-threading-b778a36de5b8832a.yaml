    Modified the behavior of the :class:`.VF2Layout` and :class:`.VF2PostLayout`
    transpiler passes, which would previously run their internal scoring using
    multithreading if the input circuits were sufficiently large. The
    multithreading usage has now been removed from the passes, as it was shown
    to cause a performance regression instead of an improvement like originally
    intended.
