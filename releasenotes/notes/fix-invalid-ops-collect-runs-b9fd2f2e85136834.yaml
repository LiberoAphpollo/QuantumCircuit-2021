    Fixed an issue introduced in 0.16.2 that would cause errors when running
    :func:`~qiskit.compiler.transpile` on a circuit with a series of 1 qubit
    gates and a non-gate instruction that only operates on a qubit (e.g.
    :class:`~qiskit.circuit.Reset`). Fixes
    `#5736 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/issues/5736>`__
