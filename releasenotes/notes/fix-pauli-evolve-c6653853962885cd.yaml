    Fixed an issue in the :meth:`qiskit.quantum_info.Pauli.evolve` method
    which could have resulted in the incorrect Pauli being returned when
    evolving by a :class:`~qiskit.circuit.library.CZGate`,
    :class:`~qiskit.circuit.library.CYGate`, or a
    :class:`~qiskit.circuit.library.SwapGate` gate.
