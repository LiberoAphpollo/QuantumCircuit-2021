    This is a bugfix release that fixes several issues from the 0.17.1 release.
    Most importantly this release fixes compatibility for the
    :class:`~qiskit.utils.QuantumInstance` class when running on backends
    that are based on the :class:`~qiskit.providers.BackendV1` abstract class.
    This fixes all the algorithms and applications built on
    :mod:`qiskit.algorithms` or :mod:`qiskit.opflow` when running on newer
    backends.
