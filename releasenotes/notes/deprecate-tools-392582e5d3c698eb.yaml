deprecations:
  - |
    The ``qiskit.tools.jupyter`` module has been deprecated and will be removed
    in Qiskit 1.0.0. This module is deprecated because the functionality in
    this module is tied to the legacy ``qiskit-ibmq-provider`` package which is
    no longer supported and also only supported :class:`.BackendV1`. If you're
    using this functionality currently, similar jupyter tools exist in the
    `qiskit-ibm-provider <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-ibm-provider>`__
    package which can be used instead. The documentation for this module can
    be found here:

    https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/api/qiskit-ibm-provider/ibm_jupyter

    The ``qiskit.tools.monitor`` module has been deprecated and will be removed
    in Qiskit 1.0.0. This module is deprecated because the functionality in
    this module is tied to the legacy ``qiskit-ibmq-provider`` package which is
    no longer supported and also only supported :class:`.BackendV1`.
  - |
    The ``qiskit.tools.visualization`` module has been deprecated and will be
    removed in Qiskit 1.0.0. This module was a legacy redirect from the original
    location of Qiskit's visualization module and was moved to
    :mod:`qiskit.visualization` in Qiskit 0.8.0. If you're still using this
    path you can just update your imports from ``qiskit.tools.visualization``
    to :mod:`qiskit.visualization`.
  - |
    The ``qiskit.tools.events`` module and the :func:`.progressbar` utility
    it exposed has been deprecated and will be removed in the Qiskit 1.0.0
    release. This module's functionality was not widely used and better covered
    by dedicated packages such as `tqdm <https://github.com/tqdm/tqdm>`__.
  - |
    The ``qiskit.tools`` module has been deprecated and will be removed in
    Qiskit 1.0.0. Except as noted in the release notes above for specific
    submodules (``qiskit.tools.jupyter``, ``qiskit.tools.monitor``, ``qiskit.tools.events`` and
    ``qiskit.tools.visualization``) the functionality in this module have
    been migrated to :mod:`qiskit.utils`. If you're using any functionality
    in this module you can update your imports from ``qiskit.tools`` to
    :mod:`qiskit.utils`.
