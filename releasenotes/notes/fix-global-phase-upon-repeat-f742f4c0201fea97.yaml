    Fix the global phase of the output of the
    :class:`~qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit` method
    :meth:`~qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit.repeat`. If a circuit with global
    phase is appended to another circuit, the global phase is currently not
    propagated. Simulators rely on this, since the phase otherwise gets
    applied multiple times. This sets the global phase of
    :meth:`~qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit.repeat` to 0 before appending the
    repeated circuit instead of multiplying the existing phase times the
    number of repetitions.
